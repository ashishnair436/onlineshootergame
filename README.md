Hi , My name is Ashish Nair and I have tried to create a simple 3D Online Shooter game with multiple random fun maps.I like to think about this game like a 3D version of the popular 2D game Mini Militia. The 12 maps existing in the games will change after a round or if the player reaches a certain kill count and any random map out of the remaining 12 maps will be immediately loaded to the master client and then communicated to all the remaining players in the room. The maps are completely designed randomly with some maps being sci-fi and futuristic while some others being filled with trees and jungles and industries and towns and cities. I have used Photon Network to do the multiplayer setup and as I am using the free Photon Server for testing purposes , only a maximum of 20 players can play at any given time together. If you are interested to play my game try to find the zip folder named "Build without invisible barrier error" . Unzip the folder on your computer. Share the same folder with people you want to play it with and enjoy the game. Thank you . 


I have attached a google drive video link if you want a quick glimpse of the gameplay
